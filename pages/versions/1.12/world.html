                    <br><h6><strong>private net.minecraftforge.common.capabilities.CapabilityDispatcher capabilities</strong> is used to wrap the results of the <strong>AttachCapabilitiesEvent</strong>.
                        Do not use this approach unless you <strong>MUST</strong> delegate to multiple providers instead of just implement y of the handlers using normal if statements. Internally,
                        the handlers are baked into arrays for fast iteration. The <strong>ResourceLocation</strong> will be used for the NBT key when serializing.</h6>

                    <br><h6><strong>init()</strong> is a <strong>public World</strong> and must return a <strong>World</strong> as a result. By default in the world class it just returns <strong>this</strong>.
                        You shouldnt <strong>NOT</strong> change this as it would change how the world works.</h6>
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>getBiome()</strong> is a <strong>public Biome</strong> and takes in a <strong>final BlockPos pos</strong>. This may be used to retrieve the 
                        biome that is at the specified block position. This returns <strong>this.provider.getBiomeForCoords(pos)</strong>.</h6>
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong>
                    <pre><code>Biome biome = worldIn.getBiome(new BlockPos(this.posX, this.posY, this.posZ);
if(biome.equals(Biomes.BEACH))

                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>getBiomeForCoordsBody</strong> is a <strong>public Biome</strong> and takes in a <strong>final BlockPos pos</strong>. This gets the chunk that the
                        specified position is in, and returns the main biome that is in this chunk.</h6>
                    <br><strong>An example of how this might be used goes as follows:</strong>
                    <pre><code>Biome biome = worldIn.getBiomeForCoordsBody(new BlockPos(this.posX, this.posY, this.posZ);
if(biome.equals(Biomes.BEACH))
{
    return true;
}</code></pre>
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>getBiomeProvider()</strong> is a <strong>public BiomeProvider</strong>. This may be used to get the world's <strong>BiomeProvider</strong> and it 
                        returns <strong>this.provider.getBiomeProvider()</strong>.</h6>
                    <br><strong>You could simply use it like this:</strong>
                    <pre><code>List&lt;Biome&gt; biomes = worldIn.getBiomeProvider().getBiomesToSpawnIn();
if(biomes.contains(Biomes.DESERT))
{
    BlockPos pos = worldIn.getBiomeProvider().findBiomePosition(pos.getX(), pos.getZ(), 1000, (List&lt;Biome&gt;) Biomes.DESERT, worldIn.rand);
    entityIn.setPosition(pos.getX(), pos.getY(), pos.getZ());
}</code></pre>  
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>createChunkProvider()</strong> is a <strong>protected abstract IChunkProvider</strong> and creates the chunk provider for this world. 
                        This is called in the constructor and retrieves the provider from <strong>worldProvider</strong>.</h6>
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>initialize()</strong> is a <strong>public void</strong> and takes in <strong>WorldSettings settings</strong>. This tells the server to be
                        initialized by doing <strong>this.worldInfo.setServerInitialized(true)</strong>.</h6>
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>getMinecraftServer()</strong> is an <strong>@Nullable public MinecraftServer</strong> and gets the minecraft server for this world. 
                        It returns <strong>null</strong> by default.</h6>
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong>
                        <pre><code>worldIn.getMinecraftServer().setBuildLimit(100);</code></pre>
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>setInitialSpawnLocation()</strong> is an <strong>@SideOnly(Side.CLIENT) public void</strong> and therefore should only be used client side. 
                        It is used to set a new spawn location by finding an uncovered block at a random(x,z) location in a chunk. 
                        It returns <strong>this.setSpawnPoint(new BlockPos(8, 64, 8))</strong>.</h6>
                    <br><strong>An example usage of this goes as follows:</strong>
                    <pre><code>worldIn.setInitialSpawnLocation();</code></pre>
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>getGroundAboveSeaLevel()</strong> is a <strong>public IBlockState</strong> and takes in <strong>BlockPos pos</strong>.</h6>
                    <br><strong>One use of this would be to check if the ground above sea level is a particular block and if so set it to another block:</strong>
                    <pre><code>if(worldIn.getGroundAboveSeaLevel(pos).getBlock().equals(Blocks.DIRT))
{
    worldIn.setBlockState(pos, Blocks.MELON.getDefaultState());
}</code></pre>
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>isValid()</strong> is a <strong>public boolean</strong> and takes in a <strong>BlockPos pos</strong>. This method checks if
                        the given block position has valid coordinates. This means that it will check that it is not outside the build height and that no x, y or z has a 
                        value greater than 30 million or less than -30 million.</h6>
                    <br><strong>An example of it's usage:</strong>
                    <pre><code>if(worldIn.isValid(pos))
{
    playerIn.jump();
}</code></pre>
                    <hr>
                    <br><h6><strong>isOutsideBuildHeight()</strong> is a <strong>public boolean</strong> and takes in a <strong>BlockPos pos</strong> as its parameters.
                        This method determines whether the block pos is at a valid height(greater than y=0 and less than or equal to 256).</h6>
