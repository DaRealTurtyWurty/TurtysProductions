        <h6>
            I have made several mods and I am consistently working on them. I used to have a mod
            named Turty's Food Mod, however due to an error with the API: 'Forge'. There was a
            bug that corrupted my mod and loads of other's which made everyone's textures and models
            fail to load. Even though this really took me away from modding for a few months, I soon
            come back not long after with lots of motivation to work on new ideas and overcome the
            massive loss. Now I am not going to lie, it was not an easy thing to do, I put a of work
            into my Minecraft Mods, silly or not. I really have a passion in programming them and
            seeing it all come to life within the game. My other mods that I have made/are making include:<br></h6>

        <h5>Turty's Chemistry:</h5>
        <h6>Turty's Chemistry is a mod which adds lots of chemistry/chemical based things to the game. This includes
            every element as well as lots of compounds which are commonly used in the chemical industry.
            Now I am no chemistry expert or scientist, I am just someone who loves chemistry, loves programming and
            loves Minecraft. Putting these all together makes a really fun gameplay experience in my opinion. This mod
            is currently still in development, so there is not a CurseForge page yet, however you can find more
            information about the mod <a href="./mymods/turtyschemistry.html">here</a></h6>
