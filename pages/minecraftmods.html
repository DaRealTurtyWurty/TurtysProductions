            <h2>What mods have I made?</h2>
            <h4>I have made several mods and I am consistently working on them. I used to have a mod
                named Turty's Food Mod, however due to an error with the API: 'Forge'. There was a
                bug that corrupted my mod and loads of other's which made everyone's textures and models
                fail to load. Even though this really took me away from modding for a few months, I soon
                come back not long after with lots of motivation to work on new ideas and overcome the
                massive loss. Now I am not going to lie, it was not an easy thing to do, I put a of work
                into my Minecraft Mods, silly or not. I really have a passion in programming them and
                seeing it all come to life within the game. My other mods that I have made/are making include:<br></h4>
