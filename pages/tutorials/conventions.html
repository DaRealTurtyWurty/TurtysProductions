            <h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
            <a id="java_naming_conventions"></a>
            <p>When it comes to naming things, we want to make sure we are naming everything in our mod using the right
                conventions. The main reason we use these conventions is to keep some consistency within people's code,
                making the jump of looking at one person's code to looking at another persons code much smaller and
                easier to handle.</p>

                            this will be a noun.

                            (_). Should well describe what is inside of that package. The starting packages of a project
                            should be any website you have, followed by the name of the project. For example
                            <code>com.google.gson</code>. If you do not own a domain, you should use your github or
                            similar url. For example <code>io.github.username.projectname</code>.

                            name (any more than 24 characters is unacceptable). This should always be a noun and should
                            well describe what this Class does.

                            the mod and optionally can contain the author's username. ModIDs can contain numbers,
                            lowercase letters, underscores and dashes. An example of a valid ModID is
                            <code>largevoidmod</code> or <code>large_void_mod</code>. An example of an invalid ModID is
                            <code>LargeVoidMod</code> or <code>4g%*lgf'#~</code>.

                            When constructing the name of a class, it is highly recommended to suffix the name with the
                            type of object. For example if we wanted a void block, we could put <code>VoidBlock</code>.
                            An unrecommended example of a class name would be <code>BlockVoid</code>.

                </tbody>
