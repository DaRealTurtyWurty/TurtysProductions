            <h3>What is Minecraft Modding?</h3>
            <p>Minecraft Modding is the act of modifying and making mods for Minecraft. However, Minecraft Modding is
                not something that should be used for making things such as hacked clients, whilst they are still
                technically modding, they are modifying the client, and these hacks are not supported by Mojang, or most
                real modders. In contrary with this lack of hacked client support however, Minecraft Modding with forge
                or fabric is fully endorsed by Mojang. If you are in doubt, you can always check Mojang's End User
                License Agreement (EULA for short) which specifies modding is ok as long as it does not redistribute
                their software or being intended for hacks, griefing or modded clients.
                If you want to find some information about the history of Minecraft Modding, I recommend reading this
                great blog by <strong>Aaron Mills</strong>: <a
                    href="https://hub.packtpub.com/brief-history-minecraft-modding/">here</a>.

                Modding can include Plugins, Forge Mods, Fabric Mods and to some extent, depending on who you speak to,
                datapacks. Obviously this is only on the Java Edition side of things. If you head over to Minecraft
                Bedrock there is the system of add-ons.
            </p>

            <h3>So what should I choose?</h3>
            <p>Now all of these different types of modding have their pros and cons. So I'm going to try and give a
                brief description of each, which should hopefully end up leading you to the right sector in terms of
                making your Minecraft Modification. Here are the options:</p>
            <h4>Forge</h4>
            <p>Forge is the classic, and most well known loader and API for making and playing mods, it also
                gives you the ability to modify and add anything you like to Minecraft.
                <br><br>Forge has a huge player base compared to its opponents, and has existed all the way since around
                Beta/Release of Minecraft.
            </p>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Forge is widely known in the Modded Minecraft community, and therefore has the most
                            popularity as a result. You are likely to get more downloads from a forge mod since the
                            player-base is larger. Likewise, there are many more, bigger modpacks for Forge.</th>
                        <th>Some of the higher up members in the forge team are considered to be "toxic" towards newer
                            users. <br> Note: This does not mean everyone in the forge team is toxic, there are
                            just specific individuals that seem to be having a bad day everyday.</th>

                        <th>
                            Since forge is not at all lightweight, you are provided with a rather large set of
                            utilities.
                            This includes things such as events and registries, all the way up to Forge Energy,
                            ItemHandler capabilities, Access Transformers and much, much more.
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            Forge is not at all lightweight. The API is quite bloated compared to other Modding APIs,
                            and therefore does a lot of things for you and this can be considered limiting.
                        </th>

                            Forge allows you to make both client only and server-side only mods.
                        </th>
                        <th>The forge documentation is massively lacking compared to your other modding options.
                            Similarly, lots of the documentation is very much so outdated, fabricating them as near
                            useless.
                        </th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Forge is Open Source, and therefore anyone can contribute by making a PR to their
                            repository.
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            It can be hard to navigate your way around the Forge API. This is because the API structure
                            is rather complex and big.

                            Forge implements all of its hooks into vanilla by patching the source code. This means you
                            are able to view the vanilla source code and see if forge has patched one of its hooks
                            there.
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            The forge registry system is considered by some users to be rather clunky and systems like
                            the DeferredRegister can be considered static-abuse.
                        </th>

            <h4>Fabric</h4>
            <p>Fabric is a fairly new Mod Loader and API for modding Minecraft. Fabric started development during 1.12
                due to the massive delay between updates. Since Forge then struggled to update from 1.12, it further
                boosted the development of Fabric as they knew it would gain some traction. There have been many, many
                other attempts to compete against Forge, but Fabric has really jumped the leaderboard in this challenge.
                Fabric's main aim is to get updates out faster than Forge for versions, and also be way more
                lightweight; They have indeed succeeded with the latter. There are also many forks of Fabric such as
                Quilt.</p>

                        <th>Since Fabric is so lightweight, you have to do a lot of things yourself. This could make the
                            modding process a lot longer, and in certain circumstances harder.</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Fabric provides the ability to mod snapshots, as they also make a Fabric API release for
                            when a snapshot comes out.
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            The Fabric Discord Server has, at least recently, been known for many
                            members of the community being offensive towards groups of people they may not necessarily
                            be part of. The are barely taking any action against people who act that way. This is
                            causing the main branch of fabric to die off and multiple forks starting to take place.
                        </th>

                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Fabric uses its own mappings system ("Yarn") which comes default with fabric. This is great
                            because the mappings are open-source and contributions are welcome.
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            In contrast, "Yarn" being Fabric's default mappings means that users are not using
                            Minecraft's Official Mappings("MojMap") which is a downside because it is best practice to
                            be using these official mappings.

                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Explicitly supports jar-in-jar mods, meaning that mods can repackage library mods inside
                            themselves. Note: This does mean that jars can end up being larger in size.
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            Any hooks that fabric makes into vanilla are implemented with mixins, meaning you will not
                            be able to see whether a fabric hook exists in a location purely by looking at the vanilla
                            sources. You instead have to look through the fabric source code and find the hook to then
                            figure out where it is being injected into.
                        </th>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Fabric is able to load significantly faster than the likes of Forge and has many FPS
                            boosting and many optimization mods, meaning that the minimum requirements can be massively
                            reduced when using Fabric.
                        </th>

                        <th>
                            There are many forks of Fabric, and it can be quite confusing to new users to know which
                            fork they should be using or if one at all. As an example, the recent rise of Quilt has
                            caused a system where some people would go to Fabric, and then others would re-direct them
                            to Quilt.

            <h4>Plugins</h4>
            <p>
                When it comes to modding, APIs such as CraftBukkit and SpigotMC/PaperMC are often suggested to users.
                Whilst these are perfectly valid APIs for modding, they likely do not produce the sort of thing you
                would consider to be a mod. These APIs making modifications that are known as "Plugins".

                <br><br>Plugins have one main difference from normal modifications, and that is that plugins are
                server-side only. And this means that the plugin only needs to be installed on the server, and the
                players don't have to worry about installing anything. However, being purely server-side, plugins are
                very limited in what they can do compared to other types of modifications. Plugins are greatly known for
                making things such as special difficulties, "Minecraft but ....." mods and other things alike. Plugins
                do not allow you to add anything to the game as such, but only modify what exists (with some exceptions,
                for example, commands). This means you cannot add things such as items, blocks, biomes, dimensions and
                any similar object. However, if you know what you are doing with plugins, you can add things such as
                entities. In addition to this, since plugins are server-side only, you are required to have a server in
                order to use them.

                <br><br>In terms of the differences between SpigotMC, CraftBukkit and PaperMC, there are not many
                feature differences. SpigotMC was built on top of the CraftBukkit code and is significantly more
                efficient with with CPU usage and memory usage. PaperMC then takes this up another level; PaperMC being
                a fork of SpigotMC, has even better performance as well as upgrading a lot of the API. PaperMC also has
                forks such as Waterfall, which is made for teleporting between servers.

                <br><br>There is also Sponge which works for making plugins. Sponge also has areas in Forge and Vanilla
                though, such as SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla.
