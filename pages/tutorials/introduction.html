            <h3>What is Minecraft Modding?</h3>
            <p>Minecraft Modding is the act of modifying and making mods for Minecraft. However, Minecraft Modding is
                not something that should be used for making things such as hacked clients, whilst they are still
                technically modding, they are modifying the client, and these hacks are not supported by Mojang, or most
                real modders. In contrary with this lack of hacked client support however, Minecraft Modding with forge
                or fabric is fully endorsed by Mojang. If you are in doubt, you can always check Mojang's End User
                License Agreement (EULA for short) which specifies modding is ok as long as it does not redistribute
                their software or being intended for hacks, griefing or modded clients.
                If you want to find some information about the history of Minecraft Modding, I recommend reading this
                great blog by <strong>Aaron Mills</strong>: <a
                    href="https://hub.packtpub.com/brief-history-minecraft-modding/">here</a>.

                Modding can include Plugins, Forge Mods, Fabric Mods and to some extent, depending on who you speak to,
                datapacks. Obviously this is only on the Java Edition side of things. If you head over to Minecraft
                Bedrock there is the system of add-ons.
            </p>

            <h3>So what should I choose?</h3>
            <p>Now all of these different types of modding have their pros and cons. So I'm going to try and give a
                brief description of each, which should hopefully end up leading you to the right sector in terms of
                making your Minecraft Modification. Here are the options:</p>
            <h4>Forge</h4>
            <p>Forge is the classic, and most well known loader and API for making and playing mods, it also
                gives you the ability to modify and add anything you like to Minecraft.
                <br><br>Forge has a huge player base compared to its opponents, and has existed all the way since around
                Beta/Release of Minecraft.
            </p>

                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th width=50%>Pros</th>
                        <th width=50%>Cons</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Forge is widely known in the Modded Minecraft community, and therefore has the most
                            popularity as a result. You are likely to get more downloads from a forge mod since the
                            player-base is larger. Likewise, there are many more, bigger modpacks for Forge.</th>
                        <th>Some of the higher up members in the forge team are considered to be "toxic" towards newer
                            users. <br> Note: This does not mean everyone in the forge team is toxic, there are
                            just specific individuals that seem to be having a bad day everyday.</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Since forge is not at all lightweight, you are provided with a rather large set of
                            utilities.
                            This includes things such as events and registries, all the way up to Forge Energy,
                            ItemHandler capabilities, Access Transformers and much, much more.
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            Forge is not at all lightweight. The API is quite bloated compared to other Modding APIs,
                            and therefore does a lot of things for you and this can be considered limiting.
                        </th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Forge allows you to make both client only and server-side only mods.
                        </th>
                        <th>The forge documentation is massively lacking compared to your other modding options.
                            Similarly, lots of the documentation is very much so outdated, fabricating them as near
                            useless.
                        </th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Forge is Open Source, and therefore anyone can contribute by making a PR to their
                            repository.
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            It can be hard to navigate your way around the Forge API. This is because the API structure
                            is rather complex and big.
                        </th>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Fabric</h4>
            <p>Fabric is a fairly new Mod Loader and API for modding Minecraft. Fabric started development during 1.12
                due to the massive delay between updates. Since Forge then struggled to update from 1.12, it further
                boosted the development of Fabric as they knew it would gain some traction. There have many, many other
                attempts to compete against Forge, but Fabric has really jumped the leaderboard in this challenge.
                Fabric's main aim is to get updates out faster than Forge for versions, and also be way more
                lightweight; They have indeed succeeded with the latter.</p>

                        <th>Since Fabric is so lightweight, you have to do a lot of things yourself. This could make the
                            modding process a lot longer, and in certain circumstances harder.</th>

                            Fabric provides the ability to mod snapshots, as they also make a Fabric API release for
                            when a snapshot comes out.
