            <h3 class="heading" onclick="location.href='#what_is_minecraft_modding'">What is Minecraft Modding?</h3>
            <p>Minecraft Modding is the act of modifying and making mods for Minecraft. Minecraft Modding is not
                something that should be used for making things such as hacked clients, whilst they are still
                technically modding, they are modifying the client to give users an unfair advantage, and these
                hacks are not supported by Mojang, or most real modders. In contrary with this lack of hacked client
                support however, Minecraft Modding with forge or fabric is fully endorsed by Mojang. If you are in
                doubt, you can always check Mojang's End User License Agreement (EULA for short) which specifies
                modding is ok as long as it does not redistribute their software or being intended for hacks,
                griefing or modded clients.

                <br><br>Modding can include Plugins, Forge Mods, Fabric Mods and to some extent, depending on who
                you speak to, datapacks. Obviously this is only on the Java Edition side of things. If you head over
                to Minecraft Bedrock there is the system of add-ons.

                <a id="where_to_start"></a>
                <br><br>If you want to find some information about the history of Minecraft Modding, I recommend
                reading this great blog by <strong>Aaron Mills</strong>: <a
                    href="https://hub.packtpub.com/brief-history-minecraft-modding/">here</a>.
            </p>

            The first thing you need to know about modding, is that Minecraft Java Edition is written in Java.
            Whilst this sounds fairly obvious, lots of people think Minecraft is written in Javascript. And as the
            saying goes, <strong>Java is as similar to Javascript as Car is to Carpet</strong>. In other words, Java
            is nothing like Javascript.

            <br><br>Once you have wrapped your brain around that hurdle, you need to make sure
            you learn Java. Once again, this may sound fairly obvious, as you need to know how to code the language
            that the game you're coding for is written in (unless that game has made a system specifically for
            modding that uses a different language - this is not Minecraft however). So you need to ensure that you
            at least know the basics of Java.

            <br><br>If you are one of the people coming to modding thinking that it is a great way
            to learn Java, I'm here to disappoint you, and tell you that would be wrong and would be a very bad
            mistake to make. I can say from experience, that it is not a good idea to come into modding with little
            to know Java experience. Both Minecraft and any Modding API will use beginner, intermediate and advanced
            concepts in their code-base, and so learning Java from that is extremely difficult.

            <br><br>Instead I recommend you check out one of the, listed below, Java tutorials to <strong>at
                least</strong> get to grips with the basics of Java and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).<br>

            <p>Fabric is a fairly new Mod Loader and API for modding Minecraft. Fabric started development during 1.12
                due to the massive delay between updates. Since Forge then struggled to update from 1.12, it further
                boosted the development of Fabric as they knew it would gain some traction. There have been many, many
                other attempts to compete against Forge, but Fabric has really jumped the leaderboard in this challenge.
                Fabric's main aim is to get updates out faster than Forge for versions, and also be way more
                lightweight; They have indeed succeeded with the latter. There are also many forks of Fabric such as
                Quilt.</p>

                            caused a system where some people would go to Fabric, and then others would re-direct them

            <p>
                When it comes to modding, APIs such as CraftBukkit and SpigotMC/PaperMC are often suggested to users.
                Whilst these are perfectly valid APIs for modding, they likely do not produce the sort of thing you
                would consider to be a mod. These APIs making modifications that are known as "Plugins".

                <br><br>Plugins have one main difference from normal modifications, and that is that plugins are
                server-side only. And this means that the plugin only needs to be installed on the server, and the
                players don't have to worry about installing anything. However, being purely server-side, plugins are
                very limited in what they can do compared to other types of modifications. Plugins are greatly known for
                making things such as special difficulties, "Minecraft but ....." mods and other things alike. Plugins
                do not allow you to add anything to the game as such, but only modify what exists (with some exceptions,
                for example, commands). This means you cannot add things such as items, blocks, biomes, dimensions and
                any similar object. However, if you know what you are doing with plugins, you can add things such as
                entities. In addition to this, since plugins are server-side only, you are required to have a server in
                order to use them.

                <br><br>In terms of the differences between SpigotMC, CraftBukkit and PaperMC, there are not many
                feature differences. SpigotMC was built on top of the CraftBukkit code and is significantly more
                efficient with with CPU usage and memory usage. PaperMC then takes this up another level; PaperMC being
                a fork of SpigotMC, has even better performance as well as upgrading a lot of the API. PaperMC also has
                forks such as Waterfall, which is made for teleporting between servers.

                <br><br>There is also Sponge which works for making plugins. Sponge also has areas in Forge and Vanilla
                though, such as SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla.

            <p>
                I will be covering tutorials only for Forge Modding, as that is the modding system that I use. You can
                view my tutorials on the <a href="../tutorials.html">previous page</a>.<br><br>

                For tutorials regarding other modding systems, I will link a few good ones here:<br><br>
