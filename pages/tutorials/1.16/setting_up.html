            <h2>Setting up The Workspace</h2>
            <p>If you have made it here, I am assume that you have <strong>at least</strong> a basic knowledge of Java
                and have decided to use Forge for making your first Minecraft Mod. Getting started with Minecraft
                Modding is super simple, don't worry. However, we have 1 more choice to make before we get started. You
                will need to decide whether you want to use Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ IDE, Visual Studio Code or (coming
                soon) Railroad IDEâ„¢. Each IDE will require you to go through a different setup process, so it is very
                important that you choose wisely. The differences between each of the IDEs is not much, but I will give
                some brief details about each.</p>

            <h3>Eclipse IDE</h3>
            <p>
                Eclipse IDE actually covers several different IDEs, however we will be talking about the Java IDE.
                Eclipse IDE uses very little memory and CPU Usage and is super fast compared to its competitors, in
                addition to this, Eclipse IDE has a very simple and intuitive layout. Eclipse has a wide range of
                developer tools that can be installed straight into your Desktop IDE including GUI Builders, Modelling,
                Charting, Reporting, Testing and much more. Eclipse also comes with a marketplace which allows you to
                install plugins and themes. The marketplace has a very wide range of plugins, some very useful for
                modding. You can read more about Eclipse Java IDE <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>IntelliJ IDE</h3>
            <p>IntelliJ is developed by the company JetBrains who develops many IDEs for a multitude of languages. For
                this reason, it is very easy to use IntelliJ IDEA if you have used any of the other JetBrains IDEs
                before. IntelliJ claims to have extremely intelligent code completion, suggestions, on-the-fly code
                analysis and reliable refactoring tools. In addition to this, IntelliJ has a plugin store where you can
                install thousands of plugins, some specific to Minecraft Modding such as the <strong>Minecraft
                    Development Plugin</strong>. Furthermore, IntelliJ claims to be used by 72% of Java Developers,
                which is a lot of people. However, with all this goodness, IntelliJ is a massive memory hog and CPU
                eater, so it may not be a very good choice for low-mid range PCs. You can read more about IntelliJ IDEA
                IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <p>Visual Studio Code surprising to many, can in-fact be used for modding. Whilst VSCode is not Java
                specific, it still has some support for the Java language. This does however mean that it is lacking
                many very useful and important Java IDE features that it's other competitors do have. If you have a very
                low-end PC and Eclipse or IntelliJ use too much memory/CPU Usage, VSCode will be your go-to option. You
                can read more about VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Railroad IDE</h3>
            <p>
                Railroad IDE is an IDE that is built specifically for Minecraft Modding. Currently Railroad IDE is still
                in it's very early stages of development and cannot yet be used as an actual IDE, at most a text editor.
                Railroad IDE, however, aims to introduce a bunch of features specific to modding that will allow you to
                quickly create JSONs for recipes, models, BlockStates and Loot Tables. Also Item Classes, Block Classes,
                BlockEntity classes, Screen classes and much more. In addition to this, Railroad IDE will be adding
                features that allow you to quickly create projects for Forge, Fabric and maybe other APIs without having
                to run a single command. As stated before though, Railroad is still in it's early stages of development
                and cannot yet be used. You can read more about Railroad IDE in my <a href="https://discord.gg/d5cGhKQ"

            <p>Now that you have chosen which IDE you are going to use, you can get started with properly creating the
                project. There are 4 different options for this depending on which IDE you chose to use:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Eclipse
                </li>
                <li>
                    IntelliJ IDEA
                </li>
                <li>
                    Visual Studio Code
                </li>
                <li>
                    Railroad IDE
                </li>
            </ul>
