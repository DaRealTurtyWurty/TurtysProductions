            <h6>
                Hello, I am TurtyWurty. You probably know me from 1 of 3 places:
                <br>1) From my YouTube Channel <a href="https://youtube.com/TurtyWurty">TurtyWurty</a>.
                <br>2) You may know me from my mods on CurseForge, you can learn more about those mods <a
                    href="pages/minecraftmods.html">here</a>.
                <br>3) You may know me from any Minecraft Modding discord, as thats generally where I hang around.

                <br><br>Now you may have a few questions specifically about me, so I'm going to have a small little FAQ
                here.<br>

                <p><strong>What do you do for a living, and what do you want to do as a job?</strong></p>
                I spend most of my time programming, this may be, web development, bot development, Minecraft Modding,
                game development or software development. This is normally separated by breaks of an hour or so
                where I will walk my dog, just go outside for a bit, and then play some games on my Xbox, or just browse
                social media on my phone if I'm really bored. The job that I want to do is either a Software Developer
                or potentially a Game Developer. Though I am currently still in school as of writing this and I am
                studying Game Development at my College.<br>

                <p><strong>Where do you live?</strong></p> Well, I'm a Turtle, so I live in the ocean, duh. Nah, but in
                all seriousness, I live in England, UK. That's all the information I'm going to disclose about that.<br>

                <p><strong>What is your favorite colour?</strong></p> <a class="orange">Orange</a><br>

                <p><strong>Do you have any pets?</strong></p> Yes, a have a dog named Lottie.<br>

                <p><strong>What games do you play and what is your favorite game?</strong></p> Now honestly, you might
                think this is obvious and the answer is Minecraft, but I actually do play a lot of other games, which I
                find really fun, the main one being Rainbow Six Siege. So if I had to choose, probably R6S to be honest.
                But I do enjoy both Vanilla Minecraft and Modded Minecraft. I also play Rocket League a lot plus
                games like Subnautica, Astroneer, Surviving Mars and other outer-worldly games.<br>

                <p><strong>Why did you start modding Minecraft?</strong></p> I started modding Minecraft because I
                really wanted a project which would allow me to continue programming, and not forget about it.
                Also the modding community for Minecraft is really good, and that means I can join a great community.
                Now originally I am sad to say that I did start with MCreator as thats what was first
                recommended to me. But I quickly found out that it was awful and extremely limiting, so I switched to
                real modding, where I started joining communities and making my mods.<br>

                <p><strong>Do you have a discord server which I can join to receive support, and show off my
                        creations?</strong></p>
                Yes, I have a discord server, which you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/d5cGhKQ">here</a>.
                This is a really great community, and everyone is super helpful. Just make sure you have learnt java
                before you try to ask a question there, as otherwise you might receive some backlash.<br><br>
