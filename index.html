                Hello, I am TurtyWurty. You probably know me from 1 of 3 places:
                <br>1) From my YouTube Channel <a href="https://youtube.com/TurtyWurty">TurtyWurty</a>.
                <br>2) You may know me from my mods on curseforge, you can learn more about those mods <a
                    href="pages/minecraftmods.html">here</a>.
                <br>3) You may know me from any minecraft modding discord, as thats generally where I hang around.

                <br><br>Now you may have a few questions specifically about me, so I'm going to have a small little FaQ
                here.

                <br><br><strong>What so you do for a living, and what do you want to do as a job?</strong> I spend most
                of my time programming,
                this may be, web development, bot development, minecraft modding, game development or software
                development. This is normally seperated by breaks of an hour or so
                where I will walk my dog, just go outside for a bit, and then play some games on my Xbox, or just browse
                social media on my phone if I'm really bored.The job that I want to do is either a Software Developer or
                potentially a Game Developer. Though I am currently still in school as of writing this and am studying
                Game Development at my College.<br><br>

                <strong>Where do you live?</strong> Well, I'm a Turtle, so I live in the ocean, duh. Nah, but in all
                seriousness, I live in England, UK.
                Thats all the information im going to disclose about that.<br><br>

                <strong>What is your favourite colour?</strong> <a class="orange">Orange</a><br><br>

                <strong>Do you have any pets?</strong> Yes, a have a dog named Lottie, and a cat named Pepe(not named
                after the frog).<br><br>

                <strong>What is your favourite game?</strong> Now honestly, you might think this is obvious and the
                answer is Minecraft, but I actually do play a lot of other games, which I find really fun, the main one
                being Rainbow Six Siege. So if I had to choose, probably R6S to be honest.<br><br>

                <strong>Why did you start modding Minecraft?</strong> I started modding Minecraft because I really
                wanted a project which would allow me to continue programming, and not forget about it.
                Also the modding community for Minecraft is really good, and that means I can join a great community.
                Now originally I am sad to say that I did start with MCreator as thats what was first
                recommended to me. But I quickly found out that it was awful and extremely limiting, so I switched to
                real modding.<br><br>

                <strong>Is there a place where I can talk to you and recieve quick help or get opinions on
                    something?</strong> Yes, I have a discord server, which you can join <a
                    href="https://discord.gg/d5cGhKQ">here</a>. This is a really great community, and everyone
                is super helpful. Just make sure you have learnt java before you try to ask a question
                there, as otherwise you might recieve some backlash ðŸ˜†.<br><br><br>
